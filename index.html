        <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Ezra Rivera but I go by my middle name Ezra, I am from Los Angeles California and I’m a full-time single dad to an amazing 10-year-old daughter. 
            I’m currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho, where I’m excited to deepen my skills in programming and 
            technology. When I’m not studying or working in sales, I focus on supporting my daughter in her many activities, including soccer, swimming, 
            church events, and violin lessons.
            I’m passionate about problem-solving and creating projects that challenge me to grow. Being a dad is my greatest joy, and I’m committed to building a bright future for both of us.
