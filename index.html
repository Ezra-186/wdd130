            <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Ezra Rivera, but I go by my middle name, Ezra. I am from Los Angeles, California, and Iâ€™m a full-time single dad to an amazing 10-year-old daughter. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho, where Iâ€™m excited to deepen my skills in programming and technology.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m particularly interested in how technology can be used to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. When Iâ€™m not studying or working in sales, I focus on supporting my daughter in her many activities, including soccer, swimming, church events, and violin lessons. She keeps me busy, but I wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything. Iâ€™m passionate about problem-solving and creating projects that challenge me to grow. Being a dad is my greatest joy, and Iâ€™m committed to building a bright future for both of us.</p>
