        <p>Hello! My name is Daniel Ezra Rivera but I go by my middle name Ezra, I am from Los Angeles California and Iâ€™m a full-time single dad to an amazing 10-year-old daughter. 
            Iâ€™m currently pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Development at BYU-Idaho, where Iâ€™m excited to deepen my skills in programming and 
            technology. When Iâ€™m not studying or working in sales, I focus on supporting my daughter in her many activities, including soccer, swimming, 
            church events, and violin lessons.
            Iâ€™m passionate about problem-solving and creating projects that challenge me to grow. Being a dad is my greatest joy, and Iâ€™m committed to building a bright future for both of us.
